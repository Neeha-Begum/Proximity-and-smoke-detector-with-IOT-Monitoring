ðŸ”¹ IoT-Based Proximity & Smoke Detection System ðŸ”¹

I designed and developed an IoT-powered security system that detects motion (proximity) and smoke levels using NodeMCU ESP8266, an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), and an MQ-2 gas sensor.

ðŸ›  How It Works:
âœ… Ultrasonic Sensor detects movement and triggers an alert.
âœ… MQ-2 Gas Sensor monitors air quality for smoke or gas leaks.
âœ… RGB LED & Buzzer provide real-time alerts for warnings.
âœ… Blynk Cloud integration enables remote monitoring & notifications.

ðŸ”— Key Features:
ðŸ“¡ IoT-Based Real-Time Monitoring
ðŸš¨ Automated Alerts for Safety
ðŸ”‹ Low Power & Cost-Effective

This project enhanced my skills in IoT, embedded systems, and cloud-based monitoring. Looking forward to exploring more innovations in smart security systems!
